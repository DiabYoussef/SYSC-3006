# SYSC-3006

**Course objectives:**

Engineers working with microprocessors and microcontrollers (including mobile devices)
must understand computer systems at this level, and these concepts form the
foundation on which more powerful computer systems are based (such as desktop
systems, servers, multiprocessors, and supercomputers). Therefore, this course
introduces students to basic computer organization and functional design down to the
gate-level abstraction, and to hardware/software interfacing.

**List of topics:**

• Computer system architecture

• Hardware/software interface

• Microcontroller examples

• Assembly language programming
  
• High‐level Language Support

• Peripheral I/O and Interrupts

**Learning outcomes:**

• Understand how a computer works at hardware/software interface through the
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

• Understand microarchitecture (computer organization) to fetch an instruction
from the memory and execute using the data path.

• Understand hardware circuits necessary to interface input/output modules using
polling and interrupt‐based techniques.

• Design finite state machines necessary for the implementation of various
instructions.

• Design hardware circuits at the core of microprocessors and microcontrollers.

• Develop machine code and corresponding assembly language programs to
implement specific programming tasks.
